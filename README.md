# Buy&Bye-Bye

## About the project
This is the final project in the software engineering course. In the course we learned how a software life cycle is conducted, starting from the initiation to the production. Throughout the course we implemented an application for Android which is a kind of illustration of the process of working on projects in the real world. The application we chose is an information system that manages stores, sellers, buyers, orders and everything related to them.

## The App

### Who is it for
The application is intended for anyone interested in buying or selling something.<br />
Got a toy you're too sorry to throw away?<br />
Are you the owner of a neighborhood grocery store and want to expand in Mobile?<br />
Do you want to buy something without leaving the house?<br />

If you answered yes to any of these questions - the app is for you!

### How to use
The application is intended for two types of users - sellers and buyers.<br />
Each seller can have as many stores as he wants, and each store will have any products he chooses.<br />
With the customers, each customer can shop at any store, order products and wait for the order to be confirmed.<br />
When the seller approves an order - it makes its way to the customer!
